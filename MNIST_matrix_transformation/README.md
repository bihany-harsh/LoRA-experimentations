## Testing Matrix Transformation as a method to Finetune (MNIST)

The following is one in a series of experiments to test the effectiveness of matrix-transformations to finetune a model. The implementation in the `empirical-verification-of-matrix-transformation.ipynb` is derived from this [this repository](https://github.com/sunildkumar/lora_from_scratch/). 

The results are present in the Python-notebook, nonetheless, this empirical verification may suggest roads towards improvement.
